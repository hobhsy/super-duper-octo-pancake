To get started, ensure you have the latest JDK installed, and download Maven from:

  http://maven.apache.org/

Then run "mvn clean package" to compile the software. You can also run "mvn site:site" to generate a website with
useful information like JavaDocs. The outputs are under the target/ directory.

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. Most good ones have Maven integration.

Now try running one of the example apps:

  cd examples
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.google.bitcoin.examples.PingService

It will download the block chain and eventually print a Bitcoin address. If you send coins to it,
you should get them back a few minutes later when a block is solved.

Now you are ready to follow the tutorial:
